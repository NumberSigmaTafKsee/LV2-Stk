# LV2-Stk

# There is no explanation why you want this
* It is a music library not an audio dsp library
* You need gamma and something else with it

# I have no idea if anyone uses this anymore
* The new theory of machine audio intelligence is faust

# You want to make a physical sound
* It is like a flute
* Yet it vibrates like the strings of a violin

# In here are the blueprints of it
* Now, you can combine them into a physical model graph
* You will need Gamma to do the audiodsp and interpolation theory
* You will need other things the machine learning theories
