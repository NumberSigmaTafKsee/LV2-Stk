# AudioLAB-STK

# Stk is old
* It was made along time ago
* There is probably not a reason why you want to use this now
* There exist much better stuff now that is easier to use

# Purpose
* I use this for experimenting with DSP algorithms
* It has all the essential theory of Julius Orion Smith in it

# Faust
* Most of JOS is now in the Faust libraries
* Most of the stuff is now completed better in there and other places
