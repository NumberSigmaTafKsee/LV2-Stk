# AudioLAB-STK

# Purpose
* To study the theory of Julius Orion Smith
* To have a small c++ dsp that works easy on raspberry/pi

# You will probably not find this useful for anything
* I mostly hack things in here
* Something to do with JOS theories

# For Learning MusicDSP Theory
* Stk   
* Faust
* Matlab/Octave
