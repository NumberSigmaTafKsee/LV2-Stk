# LV2-Stk

# There is no explanation why you want this
* It is a music library not an audio dsp library
* You need gamma and something else with it

# I have no idea if anyone uses this anymore
* The new theory of machine audio intelligence is faust

# You want to make a physical sound
* It is like a flute
* Yet it vibrates like the strings of a violin

# In here are the blueprints of it
* Now, you can combine them into a physical model graph
* You will need Gamma to do the audiodsp and interpolation theory
* You will need other things the machine learning theories


# That is the problem of sound
* All sound is physics
* If it is not physics it can not be sound

# You are walking through your local market
* Then, a hideous cacophony penetrate your ears
* It sound strangely all high pitched and reverbreating
* Yet the hideous flanging penetrates your mind and makes you feel ill

# normally, you never want that
* But, it is something that is startling you ask what is that sound and where is it coming from
* What made it and why 

# so the basic physics of sound is very obvious
* A low pass filter is someone muffled voice coming through a wall
* YOu walk by low stone fence with music playing behind it and only the high frequency goes over it and makes a high pass
