# AudioLAB-STK

# Stk is old
* It was made along time ago
* There is probably not a reason why you want to use this now
* There exist much better stuff now that is easier to use

# Purpose
* The purpose is basically to study Julius Orion Smith Books
* If you want to try the theory or do something
* You can use Matlab
* You can use Stk
* You can use Faust

# Real Sound Synthesis
* A useful book that contains alot of information not in JOS
* Or, not easy to find in the complex library of JOS

# Computational Synthesis
* It is a free PDF
* One of the best books ever about synthesis algorithms made


# Octave
* Alot of JOS uses Matlab
* So you can use them togethor

# Faust
* Most of JOS is now in the Faust libraries
* Most of the stuff is now completed better in there and other places

# It is still useable
* If you need it
* If you read JOS papers, it is mentioned sometimes in them
* Most of the essential JOS theory is in it
