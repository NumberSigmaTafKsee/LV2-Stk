# AudioLAB-STK

# Stk is old
* It was made along time ago
* There is probably not a reason why you want to use this now
* There exist much better stuff now that is easier to use

# Purpose
* The purpose is basically to study Julius Orion Smith Books
* If you want to try the theory or do something
* You can use Matlab
* You can use Stk
* You can use Faust

# Real Sound Synthesis
* A useful book that contains alot of information not in JOS
* Or, not easy to find in the complex library of JOS

# Computational Synthesis
* It is a free PDF
* One of the best books ever about synthesis algorithms made

# Gary Scavone
* He was one of the original author of Stk
* He has a website with notes from some of his classes
* he studied JOS theory with JOS
* his class notes can be helpful if you get stuck on JOS theory

# Perry Cook
* He was one of the original authors of stk
* He also studied Jos theory with Jos
* He has a web page somewhere on Princeton
* He probably does not do anything with Stk anymore
* He wrote Real Sound Synthesis which is not really useful for the purpose it was written for
* It is very useful if you want to know all the DSP theory though
* At least the book says it is for games but there is not much about game audio in it
* It is just full of all the DSP theory
* If you bought it to learn game audio you will be disappointed
* it is the best introduction to the physics audio

# Octave
* Alot of JOS uses Matlab
* So you can use them togethor

# Faust
* Most of JOS is now in the Faust libraries
* Most of the stuff is now completed better in there and other places

# It is still useable
* If you need it
* If you read JOS papers, it is mentioned sometimes in them
* Most of the essential JOS theory is in it
