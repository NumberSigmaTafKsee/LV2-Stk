# AudioLAB-STK

# Stk is old
* It was made along time ago
* There is probably not a reason why you want to use this now
* There exist much better stuff now that is easier to use

# Purpose
* I use this for experimenting with DSP algorithms
* It has all the essential theory of Julius Orion Smith in it

# Octave
* Alot of JOS uses Matlab
* So you can use them togethor

# Faust
* Most of JOS is now in the Faust libraries
* Most of the stuff is now completed better in there and other places

# It is still useable
* If you need it
* If you read JOS papers, it is mentioned sometimes in them
* Most of the essential JOS theory is in it
